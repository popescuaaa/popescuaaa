### Hi there 👋. I am Andrei and I like to build things. 

I like to work | read | share (on) projects about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 🤖, Web Development and Operating Systems. I spend most of my time reading about the newest technologies and working on side projects with them. The world full of possibilities if you have ambition and curiosity.


- 🔭 I’m currently pursuing my bachelor degree in computer science and engineering, with focus on Artificial Intelligence and working on my thesis project, a research oriented project on Time Series Generation using Generative Adversarial Models (TimeGAN)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Deep Leaning and I am using PyTorch as a day to day task.
- 👯 I’m not looking to collaborate right now 🤷🏻
